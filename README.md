Sick of having to use a centralized banker to settle poker games? Here's a way to settle these games in a decentralized manner!

## how to use
1. run this using python3
2. enter names and their net balance
3. when finished just hit enter to move onto next step
4. if there is a discrepancy in the ledger it will allow you to edit a certain player's net balance
5. if you do not want to edit a certain player's net balance, simply say no and it will offer to split the difference evenly between all players 
6. sometimes people can only be paid through certain people. this is where the proxy function comes in handy. simply enter who is getting proxied by whom.
